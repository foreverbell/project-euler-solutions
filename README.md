You may use a search engine like Google to find this place, but please, do **NOT** refer to these codes before you fully solve this problem. Copying others code is cheating and it is meaningless.

## Description

My solutions to Project Euler in Haskell.

Handle: [foreverbell](https://projecteuler.net/profile/foreverbell.png), friend key: 658700_e467bf8d1b99d40348ddabe8736a5ce2.

## Build

We provide two ways to build one solution.

* ```
$ make 42
$ Build/42
```
If ghc is complaining about missing packages, see `project-euler-solutions.cabal.in` and `configure.hs` for more details.

* (recommended) 
```
./configure.hs 42
stack init
stack build
stack exec 42
```
